This is a complete repo for my ETL dashboard containing code for small services and complete ETL pipeline as well as the dash code. The Python environments are excluded from this repo, but everything else is included. It connects to my live mongodb ERP database. The ETL.py file is run using a scheduler in schdl.etl.bat.  It relies on a secondary python module called pricing.py which contains all the functions for attaching prices.
